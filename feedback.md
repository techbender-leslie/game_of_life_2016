* **2** Exceeds expectations

| | Score | Commentary |
|---|---|---|
| **Project WorkFlow** | 1 | You were very organized and diligent about creating wire-frames and specing out your project before starting. Sharing those sketches/wire-frames in your `readme` would be nice to gain more insight into that great planning process. I see your features are reminiscent of user-stories. I would suggest formatting them as such and using Trello to keep track of them (if you did add it to the `readme`). Good job committing relatively frequently, but more often would be even more beneficial. Try matching your commit messages with the user stories that have been completed. |
| **Technical Requirements** | 1 | You ended up buidling a working game, nice job! This project demonstrates that you were able to synthesize your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. More specifically you demonstrated proficiency in JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and project management. |
| **Creativity** | 1.5 | You had an ambitious idea, but I appreciate how you were able to scope it down in order to make it work for you. Generally, you have a propensity to enjoy solving novel problems in unexpected ways. Rather than hard-coding your board in HTML, I suggest representing it as a JavaScript object and generating the HTML using its data. |
| **Code Quality** | 1 | Your functions are well named, the indentation and organization is logical. I would suggest commenting your code more frequently. Remove all unused (commented out) code, remember you can still reference previous commits. Overall the code demonstrates a solid proficiency of working with JavaScript and the DOM. |
| **Problem Solving** | 1.5 | Your game board proved to be more of a challenge than expected. You are very good at working through a problem and understanding what needs to get done at each step in order devise a solution. You are great at thinking about the big picture and putting the pieces together. As you continue you will get more experience with identifying and fixing the more trivial problems that plague all developers. |
